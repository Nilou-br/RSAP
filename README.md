Not finished yet, currently on hold as I have other priorities that need to be finished first.

Plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that automatically handles sound pathfinding in the world.
Generates an SVO asyncronously either on the CPU or from a compute-shader on the GPU.
Does not require any manual setup besides configuring the acoustic properties of your own 3d assets.
Uses ray-tracing for sound, but might add a different lower-quality option if required, like storing acoustic data on the SVO nodes.
